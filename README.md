# Pot8OS
A webpage that mimics a joke old-timey computer.

## Usage
Load up `index.html` and bask in the glory of Pot8OS^TM^! Once you get past the loading screen, it's got manual uniselectors, registers (some of which are stacks), an opcode spec and can output ASCII. It's even got a paper tape reader for its machine language :)

Yep, under the hood it's as dumb as you think, and it's not like I was simulating transistors or anything (though I'm doing that now in uni). But I had some fun living out my historical computing fantasies creating my own machine, pushing uniselectors and writing "binary" :)

## Why?
My main interest that got me started really pursuing programming was historical, low-level computing and after watching a lot of [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/computerphile) and [The 8-Bit Guy](https://www.youtube.com/c/The8BitGuy), I decided to muster up whatever I had learnt to create something that functioned superficially like a computer from the 50's (or at least what I thought it would function like).
